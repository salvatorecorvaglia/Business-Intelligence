THE SUN HAS SET
The sun has set, and the pond is still.
John, Ned, Ben, Tom and Nell stand on the bank and look at the duck.
The dog with a black spot on his back is with Tom.  
See! 
Tom has his hat in his hand. He has left his toy car on the box.
Kitty's doll is on the rock. Nell has put her pet in the cage. 
It will sing a sweet song. The duck has her nest under the rock.
It is not hot now. 
Let us run and skip on the bank. 
Do you not think it is fun?
